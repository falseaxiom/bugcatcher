<!-- tutorial dialog for Level 0 -->
<p id='0'>Hello, adventurer! <br><br><br> (Click anywhere to continue.)</p>
<p id='1'>I hear you've come to catch some <b>bugs,</b> which is fantastic!</p>
<p id='2'>I must warn you, though--these parts are dangerous to wander by yourself.</p>
<p id='3'>That's why I'm here! My name is <b>Thimis Hintz,</b> and I'll be your guide on this journey. </p>
<p id='4'>There are a few things you need to know before you go on your way.</p>
<p id='5'>First, let me tell you about the environments you'll be exploring:</p>
<p id='6'>You'll be able to view your environment in the <b style="color: var(--blue)">dark blue box</b> on the top-left.</p>
<p id='7'>There will be a description of what the environment is supposed to do in the <b style="color: var(--green)">dark green box</b> on the right.</p>
<p id='8'>You'll be able to figure out if this environment works properly by <b>running</b> through it (aka, clicking the <b style="color: var(--orange)">"run"</b> button).</p>
<p id='9'>Some environments work perfectly fine, and some don't. It's all due to whether the environment is <b>buggy</b> or not.</p>
<p id='10'>That's where you come in: Your task is to <b>catch</b> our lovely bugs and find their proper homes.</p>
<p id='11'>To catch a bug, you'll need to need to <b>rewrite</b> the code it affects.</p>
<p id='12'>Click <b style="color: var(--orange)">"run"</b> when you think you've caught all the bugs; in the <b style="background: white; color: black">black box</b> on the bottom-left, you'll either see the code's correct output, or a generic error.</p>
<p id='13'>If the <b style="color: var(--fgrey)">"next"</b> button lights up <b style="color: var(--green)">green</b> after running, you'll know you've finished debugging, and you can click it to move on!</p>
<p id='14'>There are usually gonna be a few environments per level; the number might vary depending on how far along you are.</p>
<p id='15'>I'll give you a <b>score</b> at the end of each level based on how efficiently you debugged.</p>
<p id='16'>I'll also be here to teach you about <b>new bugs</b> you might encounter before each level.</p>
<p id='17'>And if you ever need it, I'll you some <b>Hintz</b> as to what might be wrong, in the form of questions to ask yourself.</p>
<p id='18'>To get a Hint, you can click on the <b style="color: var(--green)">"ask for Hintz"</b> button.</p>
<p id='19'>You won't be penalized for taking these Hintz--after all, even the best of us need help debugging sometimes!</p>
<p id='20'>Here's an example round with a simple bug. Have fun clicking around!</p>
<p id='21'>(Oh, and one last note: If you ever replay this level, you won't have to sit through this dialog again. Enjoy it while it lasts!)</p>
