<p id='0'>Hello again! <b>Thimis Hintz</b> here.</p>
<p id='1'>Welcome to the first true environment! Before embarking on this journey, there are some special critters here that you should learn about.</p>
<p id='2'>The first are <b>brackets.</b> These little guys always travel in pairs--one open, one closed--and they must always be of matching shapes.</p>
<p id='3'>The second are <b>semicolons.</b> They usually like to hang out at the end of most lines, but are also commonly inside for-loops, separating conditions.</p>
<p id='4'>The third are <b>misspelled words,</b> which can happen pretty much anywhere.</p>
<p id='5'>Let's see how fast you can catch these bugs!</p>
