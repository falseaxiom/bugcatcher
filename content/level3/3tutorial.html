<p id='1'>Now, you know me. I'm a bug guy. I love every bug equally, and I want them all to find good homes.</p>
<p id='2'>***HOWEVER.***</p>
<p id='3'>Nothing gets my goat quite like an <b>indexing</b> bug.</p>
<p id='4'>Found almost exclusively in <b>for-loops,</b> these have always been the trickiest bugs for me to catch.</p>
<p id='5'>Commonly, the bug will manifest itself in using <b>"&lt;="</b> instead of <b>"&lt;"</b>, causing you to go <b>out of the bounds</b> of the data structure you're looping through (usually an array or a String).</p>
<p id='6'>Sometimes, when you need to increase your counter by a number other than 1, you need to account for that change in your <b>ending condition.</b></p>
<p id='7'>Still other times, you might be setting your <b>starting</b> and <b>ending conditions</b> inappropriately in the first place (e.g., setting the wrong array length).</p>
<p id='8'>Other indexing issues can arise without involving a for-loop at all, such as with the <b>charAt()</b> method, which pulls the char at a specific index of a String.</p>
<p id='9'>Bottom line: always properly consider the <b>length</b> of the data structure you're traversing, as well as the <b>increment</b> of your counter.</p>
<p id='10'>And of course, you can always ask me if you need any help!</p>
<p id='11'>Tally-ho! Let's show those bugs who's boss!</p>
