<p id='0'>Howdy! <b>Thimis Hintz</b> again.</p>
<p id='1'>Today, we'll be taking a look at <b>variable scope,</b> and the bugs that can arise from it.</p>
<p id='2'>A variable can be declared almost anywhere--inside or outside of methods, in for-loops, in if-statements, etc.</p>
<p id='3'>However, its <b>scope</b> is confined by the nearest <b>curly {} brackets.</b></p>
<p id='4'>For example, if you declare a variable inside an if-statement, you can't use it outside of the if-statement!</p>
<p id='5'>Think of the brackets as a little <b>fence</b> that contains the variable. You can't call the variable outside the fence, because it has no way of getting to you.</p>
<p id='6'>It may seem simple, but even the best bugcatchers fall prey to errors involving variable scope.</p>
<p id='7'>With that in mind... let's get to catching, shall we?</p>
