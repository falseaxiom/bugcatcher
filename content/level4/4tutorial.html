<p id='0'>Ahoy! It's <b>Thimis Hintz.</b></p>
<p id='1'>This time, our bugs are going to be a little different. We'll be looking at <b>logic bugs.</b></p>
<p id='2'>Logic bugs can be a bit difficult to catch; rather than fixing a simple mistype, we need to examine <b>our own understanding</b> of how an environment is supposed to work.</p>
<p id='3'>And because everyone thinks differently, the way you catch these bugs might be different from how I catch them, but <b>we both could be right.</b></p>
<p id='4'>(Due to of the limitations of my enviro-checking technology, though, we'll try to tackle bugs that are typically solved in only one way.)</p>
<p id='5'>Some of my colleagues in ~bugcatching academia~ like to classify logic errors into <b>three categories:</b></p>
<p id='6'>1. Common logic bugs might involve a mistake in the <b>design</b> of an environment--for example, adding two numbers when you really want their product.</p>
<p id='7'>Usually, this means you know how a program is supposed to work; you might have just fudged the math by accident.</p>
<p id='8'>2. You might also find bugs in <b>interpreting the goal</b> of an assignment--like thinking an environment should make a square, when it really should be making a circle.</p>
<p id='9'>This sort of bug typically requires <b>re-reading the specs,</b> then making sure your code outputs the same thing that the specs require.</p>
<p id='10'>3. Finally, there are bugs that arise from not knowing the <b>proper translation</b> of a certain operation into code--like not knowing to the difference between "=" and "==".</p>
<p id='11'>For these bugs, the Internet is your best friend! There's no shame in needing to look up how "printf()" works every now and then.</p>
<p id='12'>Go on, then! Those bugs aren't going to catch themselves!</p>
