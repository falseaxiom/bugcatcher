<!-- tutorial dialog for Level 1 -->
<p id='0'>Hello again! <b>Thimis Hintz</b> here.</p>
<p id='1'>Welcome to the first true environment! Before embarking on this journey, there are some special critters here that you should learn about.</p>
<p id='2'>The first are <b>brackets.</b></p>
<p id='3'>Typically, brackets will enclose methods, method arguments, array contents, et cetera.</p>
<p id='4'>These little guys always travel in pairs--one open, one closed--and they must always be of matching shapes.</p>
<p id='5'>The second are <b>semicolons.</b></p>
<p id='6'>They usually like to hang out at the end of most lines, but are also commonly inside for-loops, separating conditions.</p>
<p id='7'>The third are <b>typos.</b></p>
<p id='8'>These can happen pretty much anywhere--a misspelled method, a missing return type, a variable declared as "temp" but called as "timp"... to name a few!</p>
<p id='9'>There are <b>4 environments</b> in this level; the first 3 will be buggy versions of the same code, to make spotting bugs a little easier.</p>
<p id='10'>Well, off you go! Let's see how fast you can catch these bugs!</p>
